# About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at Tulane University, where I study the intersection of algorithmic systems, causal inference, and social impact. My work focuses on understanding how automated decision-making systems can perpetuate or mitigate bias, and how we can design fairer, more accountable technologies.

My research draws from statistics, machine learning, and social science to answer questions like:

- How can we distinguish between qualification-based disparities and unjust discrimination?
- What are the causal pathways through which bias enters algorithmic systems?
- How can we audit for fairness and transparency when we do not have audit data?

I am especially interested in applying these methods to real-world domains such as hiring, and criminal justice.

## Outside the Lab

Outside the lab, I spend a lot of time at the gym, drawing, or hanging out with our cats. I also have a long history with horses and I worked with them professionally in Europe, and they were a big part of my life for years. These days, I'm more of an observer than a rider, but I still enjoy watching and appreciating them whenever I get the chance. I also read a lot of non-fiction.
